# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic snake game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to control the snake and eat as many pieces of food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Score Tracking**: Your current score and high score are displayed on the screen.
- **Dynamic Speed**: The snake's speed increases as your score increases, adding more challenge to the game.
- **Audio Effects**: Enjoy sound effects when eating food or when the game ends.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.

## How to Play

2. **Control the Snake**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
    - Arrow Up: Move up
    - Arrow Down: Move down
    - Arrow Left: Move left
    - Arrow Right: Move right
3. **Objective**: Eat the food (red circle) that appears on the board to grow in length and increase your score.
4. **Avoid Collisions**: Do not collide with the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.
5. **Restart**: If the game ends, press any key to start a new game.
